#### Lesson 86 Out of control

The moment the speedboat struck the buoy, both men were thrown into the water. As it moved of very quickly across the water, the men began to swim towards the shore. Turning in a circle, the speedboat came staight towards them. After it had just missed them, they swam until they were out of danger. When the boat returned it had lost speed. Soon all the petrol was used up and it floated across the water.

The inspector suggested that he was lying because that morning, the 8 o'clock train broken down, so the man must have caught the 8.25.

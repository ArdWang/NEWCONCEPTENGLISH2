1 Faxes
Dialogue 1
A: Can you have the briefs [briːfs] from the Anderson [ˈændəsən] Firm’s lawyer on my desk by tomorrow morning? There are quite a few very time sensitive [ˈsensətɪv] matters with case, I am afraid I can’t wait any longer.
B: Getting those Anderson briefs has been harder than you can imagine. I have tried to contact their lawyer many times, but every time I call, his secretary says he’s meeting or out of the office, or away on business. I am beginning to think he’s trying to avoid me.
A: That’s highly possible. He knows if we miss our filing deadline, we don’t stand a chance to compete against them for the bid. Try to get a hold of him again. Give him a call and see if he can fax them first thing.
B: What if can’t speak to him directly?
A: Ask his secretary to fax them. It’s the same thing . Have them faxed over, with a copy aslo faxed to Martin’s office.
B: How do I find Martin’s fax number? Is he in your rolodex?
A: No, but you can aslo call their office and ask the secretary to give you their fax number.  I’ll email you their office number later today.
B: Okay, I’ll get on it first thing.
A: Be sure you do. I need those briefs ASAP.


So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.

The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said: 
"If you please-- draw me a sheep!" 
"What!" 
"Draw me a sheep!"

The Country Mouse and the City Mouse 

The City Mouse comes to visit his old friend, the Country Mouse, who lives in the country.  They haven’t met for a long time. So they are very happy to see each other. The City Mouse gets off the city bus.
Country Mouse: WELCOME, my old friend!
I am so happy to see you.
City Mouse: Hello there, my old friend!
I missed you very much.
Country Mouse: You must be very hungry.
Let’s go to my house.
I prepared two special dishes for you.
City Mouse: Oh, thank you very much.
I AM very hungry.
The City Mouse and the Country Mouse arrive at the Country Mouse’s tiny, old house. City Mouse looks surprised.
City Mouse: My goodness!
How can you live here?
The house is so small and old
Country Mouse: Perhaps.
But it’s very quiet and cozy.
And I am happy here.
City Mouse: Hmm.
Really?!
I can’t understand you.
Country Mouse: Sit here.
I’ll bring out the food.

The Country Mouse puts the food on the table.
Country Mouse: Here is some lunch.
Please eat.
City Mouse: You must be kidding?
Dry bread and corn?
How can you eat such things?
Country Mouse: Why?
They are the best foods in the county.
They taste very good.
City Mouse: No, thank you.
I don’t like dry bread and corn.
I like cakes and cookies.
Don’t you have any?
Country Mouse: What are they?
I have never tasted them.
Are they delicious?
City Mouse: Of course.
They are so soft, so sweet, 
and so very delicious.
I eat them very day in the city.
Country Mouse: Wow!!!
You are a lucky mouse!
I would like to taste them someday, too.
City Mouse: Please visit me anytime.
I’ll show you the city.
And you can eat delicious food every day.
Country Mouse: Really?
I can eat cakes, cookies, 
and sweets every day?
City Mouse: Of course.
Country Mouse: I am so excited.
Can I visit you tomorrow?
City Mouse: I have a great idea!
Country Mouse: What is it?
City Mouse: Visit me today!
Country Mouse: Today?!
City Mouse: Yes! Right now!
Country Mouse: Right now?
City Mouse: Yes!
Come with me now.
Country Mouse: Really?
Okay!
City Mouse: Let’s go…
City Mouse:…TO THE CITY!!!
Country Mouse: Y-a-h-o-o!
The City Mouse and the Country Mouse get on a bus to the city
City Mouse: We get off here.
Country Mouse: Wow!
Look at the tall buildings and bright lights.
The city is so beautiful.
What is that?
City Mouse: It’s a truck.
Be careful!
Country Mouse: Oh, I didn’t know.

The city Mouse and the country Mouse finally arrive at the City Mouse’s red brick house.
City Mouse: There is my house.
Let’s go inside.
Country Mouse: Wow!
Your house is so big and beautiful.
You are a lucky mouse.
City Mouse: Let’s go into the kitchen.
I’m so hungry.
Country Mouse: Look! Cheese!
City Mouse: Stop!
Don’t touch it!
Country Mouse: Why not?
I love cheese.
City Mouse: That is a mousetrap.
If you eat the cheese,
you will get trapped.
Be careful.
Country Mouse: Oh, I didn’t know.
The City Mouse and the Country Mouse climb up to the kitchen table.
Country Mouse: You eat like this every day?
There is so much food.
City Mouse: Here, try this chocolate cake.
Country Mouse: Mmm.
It’s so soft, so sweet, and so very delicious.
City Mouse: Try this butter cookie, too.
Country Mouse: Yummy! Yummy!
I want some more.
City Mouse: Ssh…
Be quiet.
I hear something.
Country Mouse: What?
City Mouse: Uh-oh.
It’s Old Yellow.
Country Mouse: Who’s Old Yellow?
City Mouse: It’s the master’s dog.
Hide behind the cake!
Country Mouse: Why?
City Mouse: Don’t ask questions!
Just hide!

Old Yellow comes in the kitchen.
Old Yellow: Grrrrrr…
Old Yellow starts sniffing around the kitchen table. 
City Mouse: (in a whisper)
Stay still!!!
Don’t breathe.
Don’t make a sound!
Old Yellow: I smell mice.
		Come out, come out
		wherever you are!
Arf! Arf! Arf!

Old Yellow starts barking and running around the table.
Country Mouse: I’m so afraid.
City Mouse: Me too.
			But, get ready to run!
Mr. Strawberry: (voice coming from the living room)
Come here, Old Yellow!
You need a bath.
Old Yellow: I’ll be back.
Grrrrrr…

Old Yellow leaves the kitchen growling.
City Mouse: Thank goodness!
Old Yellow is gone.
We are safe now.
Country Mouse: My goodness!
How can you live here?
City Mouse: It’s not too bad.
You just have to be careful.
Let’s have some more cook.
Country Mouse: Are you sure it is safe?
City Mouse: Of course.
Let’s eat.
I am still hungry.
The City Mouse and the Country Mouse start eating again. This time, Fluffy, a cat, appears.
Fluffy: Meow. Meow. Meow.
I smell mice.
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

Fluffy sees the two mice and jumps up on the table.
Fluffy:	Oh, there you are!
City Mouse: Quick!!
Jump!!!
Run! Run! Run!
Run for your life!
Country Mouse: Help me! Help me!
I don’t know where to run!
City Mouse: Here! This way!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Inside my hole!
Quickly!

The City Mouse and the Country Mouse run into the mousehole. Both of them are out of breath, but they are safe.
City Mouse: Are you okay?(out of breath)
Country Mouse: Yes.
But I am very scared.
City Mouse: Don’t worry.
Fluffy can’t get in here.
Country Mouse: How can you live here?
It’s so dangerous.
City Mouse: It’s not too bad.
You just have to be a fast runner.
Country Mouse: I’m going back home.
City Mouse: Why?
Please stay a little longer.
Country Mouse: No, thanks.
The city is too dangerous.
City Mouse: But there is still a lot of food left.
Country Mouse: You can eat it all.
I’m going back to the country
and eat my dry bread and corn.
City Mouse: But they taste terrible.
Country Mouse: Perhaps.
But there are no trucks, dogs, 
or cats in the country.
City Mouse: You are a lucky mouse.
